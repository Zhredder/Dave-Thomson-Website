Back when I first started getting into web design, I wanted real world experience of how it's like to build a website for someone. I looked for people that would be willing to give me a chance. I found Dave Thomson, a model and doctor from Australia. 

He wanted a modelling website made for him, to show off his portfolio. We got together and worked on the image that he was going for, what's he trying to achieve with his website, etc. I was not only learning web development but sales too! The website was mainly built with HTML and CSS. 

It wasn't smooth sailing as there were technical issues that needed to be resolved. After a good learning experience, we were able to put up a decent website. Nothing very fancy but it worked for his needs and I learned a lot. Unfortunately, the url is no longer active but I remembered that I recorded the entire website to show to Dave. I want to look back, I don't know 20 years later and see where I started.
